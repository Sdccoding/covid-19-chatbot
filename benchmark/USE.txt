In addition, the emergence of a potential trans-species epidemic in China since
then [3] may be linked to the fact there is no known or reported airborne
transmission [2]. However, the detection of SARS-coronavirus in animal animals
is not due to such direct airborne transmission as the animal is likely to play
an important role in the transmission [12, 13]. While bats are currently
considered as an emerging mammalian order under the ICTV (Table S1 ) [22, 23,
24] , the possibility of animal-to-animal interactions as well as indirect
transmissions and trans-species transmission remains a topic for.

| ANSWER #1                                                                   |

We have outlined evidence that, in addition to the potential to cause a global
pandemic, infection with this novel coronavirus can lead to severe
complications. We have identified several important implications in an outbreak
to emerge at a global scale. We have highlighted the potential value of
collaboration between national and global scientists.

| ANSWER #2                                                                   |

The relationship between risk conditions, including infection risk,
transmission to other health workers, and patient-to-patient transmission has
been analyzed in the context of patient flow, blood vessel walls, and the ED
and in the context of the transmission mechanism and host factors. Such methods
are referred to as "functional" functional imaging [5] , "functional virology
[5] , or "functional virology [6]. Such virology, even in its simplest form,
has proven to be a useful tool in the analysis of infectious diseases.

| ANSWER #3                                                                   |

In some settings, the WHO recommends a three-step process for establishing
contact: (i) one end-to-end route; (ii) a direct link for the duration of
transmission; and (iii) at a minimum, the process to establish an onward
transmission chain. 4,5 To determine the pathogen(s) to travel from a city, to
work, or to travel into an area with known infection clusters, it is important
to determine the possible routes through which an infectious individual travels
to and from where transmission may occur. To this end, epidemiological data can
be collected retrospectively to determine contacts and connections between
individuals with known exposure.

| ANSWER #4                                                                   |

If sufficient knowledge exists, then actions and systems aimed at preventing
and containing global spread can be developed. The WHO global health framework
aims to reduce risk to global health through policy and regulatory action.
Policy aims to influence, as far as it is feasible and costeffective, policy
and regulatory decisions that will influence how countries control infectious
disease interventions.
