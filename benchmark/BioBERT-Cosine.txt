BioBERT-Large v1.1 (+ PubMed 1M) - based on BERT-large-Cased (custom 30k
vocabulary)

Warning: some of the sentences have more tokens than "max_seq_len=25" set on
the server, as a consequence, embeddings might be less-accurate (or truncated).

In addition, the emergence of a potential trans-species epidemic in China since
then [3] may be linked to the fact there is no known or reported airborne
transmission [2]. For example, a number of reports have suggested that animal
and human hosts may have provided the necessary environment for the
transmission of COVID-19 in people and poultry [14] [15] [16]. While bats are
currently considered as an emerging mammalian order under the ICTV (Table S1 )
[22, 23, 24] , the possibility of animal-to-animal interactions as well as
indirect transmissions and trans-species transmission remains a topic for.

We have identified several important implications in an outbreak to emerge at a
global scale. The case of COVID-19 has demonstrated the ability to be managed
rapidly and effectively during a crisis or emergency. The case of COVID-19 has
illustrated an important, but underappreciated, capability and the opportunity
for collaboration between global health, the global private sector, and other
global institutions.

Thus, the ability to control the spread of infection and to control the death
of infected persons in the ED is of crucial importance for public health [3].
The relationship between risk conditions, including infection risk,
transmission to other health workers, and patient-to-patient transmission has
been analyzed in the context of patient flow, blood vessel walls, and the ED
and in the context of the transmission mechanism and host factors. Therefore,
functional virology has been utilized to test the role of ETAs, the extent of
fluid overload, ED fluid handling, and the length of hospital stays in
predicting mortality of Ebola patients [10, 11].

Data regarding the route from the place of residence to where the infection is
exported to the environment can help to identify the routes that are most
important in determining routes of spread. In addition to routes in the air, we
explored the potential routes of movement of a specific agent from their
residence to places with known COVID-19 case clusters. Finally, we explored the
potential connection through which each country transmits the infection.

| ANSWER #4                                                                   |

If sufficient knowledge exists, then actions and systems aimed at preventing
and containing global spread can be developed. The following section will also
address the interrelated questions described above, and provide strategies that
can be implemented to control global spread of infectious diseases. Policy aims
to influence, as far as it is feasible and costeffective, policy and regulatory
decisions that will influence how countries control infectious disease
interventions.
