Do the spread patterns of COVID-19 occur predominantly in coastal areas and not in other areas of the world? If so, how? The main question that we have to answer is: (1) how are people in other countries to adapt to new infections, and how do they get to the US and other neighboring countries? (2) how do the newly emerging infections spread, and what do US public health officials do with the new infections? (3) What happens to people after they arrive? (4) how do they spread disease over long distance to the US? (5) at what stage do they develop a severe infection? (6) how do new diseases break into a large number of people, and how can our health-centered approaches to health prevent these infectious diseases in people? For decades, emerging pathogens have been a major threat for public health, especially when they are asymptomatic or are highly virulent Do the spread patterns of COVID-19 occur predominantly in coastal areas and not in other areas of the world?

In order to monitor infection and spread, a global map of the COVID-19 epidemic was also established for measuring its global spread A map was constructed in which the geographic coordinates were aligned with the epidemic peaks In order to monitor infection and spread, a global map of the COVID-19 epidemic was also established for measuring its global spread
