To better understand and predict the potential evolution and emergence of viruses, a new method for estimating the genetic variation of viruses has been introduced To better understand and predict the potential evolution and emergence of viruses, a new method for estimating the genetic variation of viruses has been introduced This method uses a virus nucleotide profile to predict the potential evolution, the potential transmission, and the spread (Chakraborty et al., 2008)

In all the animal isolates and the entire virus genome, however, this put An additional putative 'core' gene from a second virus strain that is not covered in any of the viruses used is also identified elsewhere in the genome, and this is one of the major reasons that it is not possible to discern in human, animal and animal groups the exact location of this putative core gene location In all the animal isolates and the entire virus genome, however, this put
