However, the detection of SARS-coronavirus in animal animals is not due to such
direct airborne transmission as the animal is likely to play an important role
in the transmission [12, 13]. For example, a number of reports have suggested
that animal and human hosts may have provided the necessary environment for the
transmission of COVID-19 in people and poultry [14] [15] [16]. While bats are
currently considered as an emerging mammalian order under the ICTV (Table S1 )
[22, 23, 24] , the possibility of animal-to-animal interactions as well as
indirect transmissions and trans-species transmission remains a topic for.

We have identified several important implications in an outbreak to emerge at a
global scale. The case of COVID-19 has demonstrated the ability to be managed
rapidly and effectively during a crisis or emergency. The case of COVID-19 has
illustrated an important, but underappreciated, capability and the opportunity
for collaboration between global health, the global private sector, and other
global institutions.

Such correlation is significant, yet it has been reported that the relationship
of ED fluid volume with patient status could not be explained by the underlying
mechanisms of ED liquid handling or the extent of fluid overload [9].
Therefore, functional virology has been utilized to test the role of ETAs, the
extent of fluid overload, ED fluid handling, and the length of hospital stays
in predicting mortality of Ebola patients [10, 11]. However, it has proven to
be very difficult for the diagnosis and monitoring of ED fluid quantity and
quality.

4,5 To determine the pathogen(s) to travel from a city, to work, or to travel
into an area with known infection clusters, it is important to determine the
possible routes through which an infectious individual travels to and from
where transmission may occur. Data regarding the route from the place of
residence to where the infection is exported to the environment can help to
identify the routes that are most important in determining routes of spread. In
addition to routes in the air, we explored the potential routes of movement of
a specific agent from their residence to places with known COVID-19 case
clusters.

| ANSWER #4                                                                   |

If sufficient knowledge exists, then actions and systems aimed at preventing
and containing global spread can be developed. For example, WHO global health
policy aims to prevent all events, from birth to death, including: (i)
providing global health assistance to countries at risk; (ii) sharing resources
with those in need; and (iii) ensuring access of health facilities to care
(11). This section is dedicated to global health systems at the national scale
to address risk-based action strategies against infectious diseases and
mitigate regional and international impacts.
