What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability of COVID-19?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| ANSWER #0                                                                   |

For example, a number of reports have suggested that animal and human hosts may have provided the necessary environment for the transmission of COVID-19 in people and poultry In fact, all known animal hosts that have been associated with animal-to-human transmission of COVID-19 are wild birds, including chickens, geese, mule deer, herons, and turkey In fact, all known animal hosts that have been associated with animal-to-human transmission of COVID-19 are wild birds, including chickens, geese, mule deer, herons, and turkey

How does its spread in the health care system affect treatment and prevention? Here I analyze the relationship between the diffusion and effect of transmission with different transmission routes, with the goal of identifying and characterizing risk conditions that may lead to the spread of and mortality among healthcare workers The relationship between risk conditions, including infection risk, transmission to other health workers, and patient-to-patient transmission has been analyzed in the context of patient flow, blood vessel walls, and the ED and in the context of the transmission mechanism and host factors The relationship between risk conditions, including infection risk, transmission to other health workers, and patient-to-patient transmission has been analyzed in the context of patient flow, blood vessel walls, and the ED and in the context of the transmission mechanism and host factors

To determine the pathogen(s) to travel from a city, to work, or to travel into an area with known infection clusters, it is important to determine the possible routes through which an infectious individual travels to and from where transmission may occur In addition to routes in the air, we explored the potential routes of movement of a specific agent from their residence to places with known COVID-19 case clusters In addition to routes in the air, we explored the potential routes of movement of a specific agent from their residence to places with known COVID-19 case clusters
