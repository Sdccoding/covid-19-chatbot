We know that prophylaxis requires long-term support of therapy, a major burden, which is often associated with high risk as well as high cost Because of their critical role in viral pathogenesis and host defense against infections, several drugs have been developed against COVID-19 Because of their critical role in viral pathogenesis and host defense against infections, several drugs have been developed against COVID-19

We know that it is not as simple as a single dose for protection, yet the vaccine market is still relying on vaccines for seasonal influenza and some other pathogens The initial step is to search for effective vaccines or therapeutics that can control the virus, a task that may prove challenging due to the diverse nature of the virus We know that it is not as simple as a single dose for protection, yet the vaccine market is still relying on vaccines for seasonal influenza and some other pathogens

The idea of a vaccine against viral diseases has long been debated, and vaccination has been largely controlled by the development of vaccines that are effective at the time of application Perhaps the development of a "pre-boost" (pre-vaccine) vaccine is the first option, in which the vaccine is pre-or early in life, to combat an infectious disease The idea of a vaccine against viral diseases has long been debated, and vaccination has been largely controlled by the development of vaccines that are effective at the time of application
